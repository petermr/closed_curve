# Closed Curve Project Log

## Project Start: [Current Date]

### Initial Setup
- ✅ Configured GitHub repository with proper .gitignore
- ✅ Created README.md with project documentation
- ✅ Initial commit completed
- ✅ Remote repository created manually on GitHub

### Current Task: Drawing Series of Closed Curves
- ✅ Explored existing legacy code structure
- ✅ Analyzed multiple closed curve implementations
- ✅ Found sophisticated nested polygon system with error transmission
- ✅ Identified cellular deposition algorithms
- ✅ Will create comprehensive series of closed curves

### Legacy Code Analysis
- **closed_curve.py**: Basic Bézier curve with GUI controls
- **closed_curve5.py**: Advanced nested polygons with error transmission simulation
- **curves.py**: Cellular deposition algorithm with 4-neighbor connectivity
- **Multiple PNG outputs**: Various raster deposition patterns with different connectivity

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Explore existing legacy code structure
2. ✅ Understand current closed curve implementations
3. ✅ Create new curve drawing scripts with different algorithms
4. ✅ Generate comprehensive series of visualizations
5. Create instructions.md for reproducibility

### Step 1: Circle Drawing ✅
- **Task**: Draw circle of radius 450 with line thickness 3 using antialiasing
- **Canvas**: 1000x1000 white square
- **Graphics System**: PIL (Pillow) with ImageDraw
- **Output**: Both PNG and SVG formats
- **File**: `step1_circle.py` - flake8 compliant with 88-char line limit
- **Results**: 
  - `output/step1_circle.png` - Raster image with antialiasing
  - `output/step1_circle.svg` - Vector format for scalability
