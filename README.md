# Closed Curve Project

This project contains legacy code for working with closed curves and related mathematical visualizations.

## Project Structure

- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `examples/` - Example code and demonstrations
- `images/` - Generated images and visualizations
- `legacy/` - Legacy Python scripts and implementations

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any requirements.txt exists)
4. Explore the examples in the `examples/` directory

## Legacy Code

The `legacy/` directory contains various Python scripts for:
- Closed curve implementations
- Cellular deposition algorithms
- Raster deposition with different connectivity patterns
- Anti-aliasing techniques

## Documentation

See the `docs/` directory for additional documentation and how-to guides.
